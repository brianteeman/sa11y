						<p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniforms" target="_blank">caniforms (opens in new
								window)</a>, or
							doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread,
							appearing in a
							wide variety of habitats throughout the
							Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
							continents of North
							America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include
							large bodies with
							stocky legs, long
							snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and
							short tails.
						</p>

						<p>While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on
							bamboo, the
							remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting
							individuals and
							mothers with their young, bears
							are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animals"
								target="_blank">solitary
								animals.</a> They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.
							Despite their heavy
							build and awkward gait, they are
							adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their
							dens; most
							species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100
							days.</p>

						<p>The FAMILY URSIDAE IS ONE OF THE NINE families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike"
							carnivorans,
							within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and
							musteloids.
							Modern bears comprise eight species
							in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae
							(monotypic with the
							spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera,
							depending on the
							authority). Nuclear chromosome
							analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each
							having 74
							chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These
							smaller numbers
							can be explained by the fusing of
							some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but
							differ from
							those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather
							than in
							Procyonidae, where they had been placed
							by some earlier authorities.</p>

				<p>The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis
					(late
					Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30
					Mya),
					both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and
					raccoon-like
					in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. Parictis does not appear
					in
					Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.[14] It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present
					in
					Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a
					major sea
					level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene.
					European
					genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about
					18 Mya),
					are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.</p>

						<p><em>The raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily
								Hemicyoninae, which
								first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya.[15] The subfamily
								includes the younger
								genera Phoberocyon (20–15
								Mya), and Plithocyon (15–7 Mya). A Cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus
								Ursavus during the early
								Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is
								ancestral to all living
								bears. Species of Ursavus
								subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during
								the early Miocene
								(21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15
								and 20 Mya,[24][25]
								likely via the species
								Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas)
								were the first to
								diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have
								been found before about
								5 Mya.</em></p>
