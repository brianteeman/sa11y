# Sa11y
Sa11y works as a simple in-page checker that is designed to be easily customized and integrated into any content management system (CMS) to facilitate good accessibility practices. Sa11y works best in a templated CMS environment, although is also available as a bookmarklet. Sa11y is _not_ a comprehensive code analysis tool. Sa11y exclusively highlights content issues.
- Over 50 test conditions.
- Free and open source.
- Concise tooltips explain issues right at the source.
- Low tech: No complex API or integrations. Vanilla JavaScript.
- Easily customizable: add your custom rulesets.
- Automatic: checks content on page load.
- Additional (toggleable) checks: Contrast, form labels, readability, links (Advanced).
- Dark mode.

## Demo and bookmarklet 
:arrow_right: [View project website and demo](https://ryersondmp.github.io/sa11y/) or grab the latest [bookmarklet.](https://ryersondmp.github.io/sa11y/#install)

## Installation
Sa11y uses [Tippy.js](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs), a highly customizable tooltip library that features a positioning system. Positioning systems ensure that tooltips are never hidden by conflicting CSS styling such as `overflow: hidden;`.

To install on your website, insert Sa11y right before the closing `</body>` tag. Include both Tippy.js and Popper.js before Sa11y. Sa11y consists of three files (located in `/src/`).

- **sa11y.css**: The main stylesheet. Should be included in the `<head>` of the document (if possible).
- **sa11y-english.js**: Global configurations and exclusions go here. All text strings and tooltip messages are located here for easy translation.
- **sa11y.js**: Contains all logic and rulesets.

### Example installation:
```html
//Tippy.js v6 CDN (tooltip library)
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@popperjs/core@2"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@6"></script>

//Sa11y (fork the latest code from GitHub)
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sa11y.css"/>
<script src="sa11y-english.js"></script>
<script src="sa11y-v2.js"></script>
```

#### Other notes
- This version appends tooltips to the end of the body by default to ensure tooltips do not get hidden by conflicting CSS styling. If you customize the tooltips to include interactive content, please read [Tippy.js documentation on creating accessible interactive tooltips for keyboard users.](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/accessibility/#interactivity)


### Create your own rule sets
1. Create your condition (within the QA module for example.
2. Add `this.warningCount++;` or `this.errorCount++;` to update warning or error count.
3. Add respective CSS classes.
4. Add warning or error button before (or after) element using the `Sa11yAnnotate` function, followed by the type `sa11yError`, `sa11yWarning`, `sa11yGood`. Finally, reference your tooltip message.

#### Example: Warn content authors of overusing a component.
The example condition detects if more than one announcement is detected on a page. If it detects more than one instance of the .announcement-component CSS class, it will be indicated as a warning. The warning button will only appear on every instance except the first component. `M['announcementWarningMessage']` represents a string (tooltip message).

```javascript
let $checkAnnouncement = document.querySelectorAll(".announcement-component");
if ($checkAnnouncement.length > 1) {
    this.warningCount++;
    for (let i = 1; i < $checkAnnouncement.length; i++) {
        $checkAnnouncement[i].classList.add("sa11y-warning-border");
        $checkAnnouncement[i].insertAdjacentHTML("beforebegin", Sa11yAnnotate(sa11yWarning, M["announcementWarningMessage"]));
    }
}
```
